# react-transform

React Transform specifies a common API for an ecosystem of React component instrumentation.  
Just kidding, it doesnâ€™t specify anything yet.

For now, refer to (the only so far) reference implementation: [babel-plugin-react-transform](https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform).  
If there is enough interest, we can make this work outside of Babel.
