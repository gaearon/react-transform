# react-transform

React Transform specifies a common API for an ecosystem of React component instrumentation.  
Just kidding, it doesnâ€™t specify anything yet.

For now, refer to (the only) reference implementation: **[babel-plugin-react-transform](https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform)**.  
If there is enough interest, we can make this work outside of Babel.

You can also geek out at **[react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate)**:
